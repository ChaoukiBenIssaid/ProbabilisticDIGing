Next Steps:

- Partition the dataset in a non-uniform way (see FedProx paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06127.pdf and github folder: https://github.com/litian96/FedProx/blob/d2a4501f319f1594b732d88315c5ca1a72855f50/data/mnist/generate_niid.py) or the paper by Sumudu at el. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06796.pdf) + code (in the new folder data partition).
- There is these folders explaining some of the non iid partitioning of the data: https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/NIID-Bench and https://github.com/IBM/FedMA (see https://github.com/IBM/FedMA/blob/master/utils.py or https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/NIID-Bench/blob/main/utils.py)
- Non-IIDness by sorting the labels, then divinding the data as in the FedAvg paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf)
