Next Steps:

- Partition the dataset in a non-uniform way (see FedProx paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06127.pdf and github folder: https://github.com/litian96/FedProx) or the paper by Sumudu at el. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06796.pdf) + code (in the new folder data partition).
- Non-IIDness by sorting the labels, then divinding the data as in the FedAvg paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf)
